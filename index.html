        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I approach projects with an emphasis on clarity, collaboration, 
          and continuous improvement. I enjoy working in team-based environments
           where ideas can be challenged and refined, and I value clear 
           communication when translating technical concepts into practical 
           outcomes. I am comfortable taking initiative when needed and enjoy 
           contributing both independently and as part of a team.</p>

        <p class="box-experience">My life in polytechnic has taught me that some things in
          life are not meant to be perfect from the start. It is through making mistakes 
          and learning from them that we grow and improve. In previous stages of my life, I
          often made mistakes with no real consequences. However, in polytechnic, I have come to
          understand that mistakes can have significant impacts, both on myself and those around me.
        </p>
        <p class="box-experience"> I believe that embracing mistakes as opportunities for growth is essential for personal
          development. By learning from our errors, we can become more resilient, adaptable, and 
          better equipped to handle challenges in the future.
